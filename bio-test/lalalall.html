      <p class="song-lyrics">Come on and see what my dog can do<br>
        He's putting on a show for you<br>
        Can you believe your eyes<br>
        He can do everything he tries<br>
        There's no dog that is quite as smart<br>
        And he's got a great big heart<br>
        Just ask any boy or girl<br>
        He's the best dog in the world</p>

      <p class="song-lyrics">Come on and see what my parrot can do<br>
        She's putting on a show for you<br>
        Can you believe your eyes<br>
        She can do everything she tries<br>
        There's no bird that is quite as smart<br>
        And she'd got a great big heart<br>
        Just ask any boy or girl<br>
        She's the best bird in the world</p>

      <p class="song-lyrics">Come on and see what my chimp can do<br>

        He can do everything he tries<br>
        There's no chimp that is quite as smart<br>
